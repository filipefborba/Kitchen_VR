# How to Play

Download this repository, use Unity version 2018.4 and click play. There might be dependency issues which you'll need to resolve by yourself.

The main objective is to prepare burguers as they are requested by your customers. You can check out the orders at the front of the kitchen.  
You need to stack ingredients, cook the meat, ring the bell and, most importantly, have fun!

**This project was tested and played with HTC Vive only.**
